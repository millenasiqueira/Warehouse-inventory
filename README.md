# Warehouse-inventory

Efficient inventory management is a critical component of any business, ensuring accurate stock levels and streamlined operations. To address this need, I developed an automated inventory counting system leveraging advanced computer vision technologies. This project utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to recognize and count items in a warehouse environment.

The project began with data collection inside my fatherâ€™s warehouse, where I captured nearly 50 images of various inventory items. Using Roboflow, I annotated and prepared a high-quality dataset, dividing it into training, testing, and validation sets. The annotated data enabled the YOLOv5 model to learn how to accurately detect and count items, even in a real-world setting with varying lighting conditions and complex arrangements.

This solution not only enhances the accuracy and speed of inventory counting but also demonstrates the practical application of AI in small-to-medium-sized business operations. It serves as a prototype for scalable, automated inventory systems adaptable to diverse environments.
